Document your work and explain what are the limits of your printer(s) (in a group or individually). 3D Printing \u00b6 3D printing is a process of fabricating a three dimensional objects through a 3D digital model created in a Computer-Aided Design software (CAD). The process consists of the arrangement of successive layers to create the object and each layer can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object. 3D Printer - Ultimaker 2+ \u00b6 The Insper Fab Lab is equipped with two models of 3D printers, the Ultimaker 2+ and a Zmorph 2.0 SX . For this group assignment we used the Ultimaker printer to test the design rules and document its limits. Here are the equipment specifications: Print technology: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Build volume : 230 x 225 x 205mm Filament diameter: 2.85 mm Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm Print speed: 30 mm/s - 300 mm/s Supported Filaments: PLA and ABS. Overall Size: 357 x 342 x 388mm File Transfer: Standard SD card Printing Software: Cura Preparing for printing in the Cura \u00b6 To fulfill the requirements of this assignment, I used the 3D Printer Test Models created by Make Magazine . It is possible to download the files here . The test models avaiables in those files are: Dimensional Accuracy Bridging Performance Overhang Performance Negative Space Tolerance Fine Positive Features Performance XY Resonance Z Resonance I imported the files into Cura , a software developed by Ultimaker where is possible to set up the printing configurations and parameters. I set up the printing for PLA material and with the following parameters: Layer Height: 0.15mm Wall Line Count: 4 Top Layers: 6 Bottom Layers: 6 Infill Density: 15% Infill Pattern: Grid Print Speed: 45mm/s Build Plate Adhesion Type: Raft Here is a preview from Cura of the printing showing that it going to take almost 10 hours of printing. I exported a .gcode file to a SD Card and pluged in it into the printer. From the main menu I selected the \"print\" option followed by the selection of the .gcode file. The buildplate and the hotend will start to heat up until 60\u00b0C and 200\u00b0C respectively (temperatures set up for PLA material) and as soon the temperature is reached, the printing process will start. By the end of the process, I got the following result: Unfortunately, I notice that some shapes from this print did not came up as I expected. On the the dimension accuracy model and the negative space tolerance model the cylinders did not came out rounded but with an elliptical shape. This happened cause the axis and belts from the printer were not aligned and tied enough. Then I needed to adjust them and repeat the printing process. After disassembling, cleaning, aligning and assembling the printer again, I printed the testers one more time and got a better result. With that issue fixed, I could evaluate the testers that were printed. Dimensional Accuracy \u00b6 The Dimensional Accuracy test came out as expected. After fixing the alignment issue that resulted in a elliptical body, the second printed tester came out rounded as planned and with the dimensions according to the digital model. Here it is the dimensions of the digital model: Here it is the dimensions of the printed part: Bridging Performance \u00b6 The Bridging Test also presented good results. The bridges were formed in all levels, but got a better finishing with the first and second one. I would recommend brigdings considering those distances.","title":"6. 3D Scanning and Printing"},{"location":"3D%20Scanning%20and%20Printing/#6-3d-scanning-and-printing","text":"","title":"6. 3D Scanning and Printing"},{"location":"3D%20Scanning%20and%20Printing/#group-assignment","text":"Test the design rules for your printer(s).

Computer-Aided Design \u00b6 The Assignment \u00b6 Model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project. 2D Softwares - Raster and Vector \u00b6 Krita \u00b6 Krita is a software for illustration creation, concept art, animation and it can also be used as photo editting tool. Krita works with raster images what is a image that uses bits to store information. With more bits, more resolution we get from the image but more disk space the image will take up. I chose Krita to create, to refine, and to render my concept skecth presented in my Principles and Practices page. Here it is the steps I used sketch my project: My first step was creating a sketch by hand. I took a picture of it and imported it into Krita. Krita has features very similar to Photoshop where I can control layers to work on the drawing. Then I included the picture in my second layer, to use it as reference for my next steps. The next step was to start drawing over the picture to refine the sketch. Then I created one more layer over it. To make drawings in Krita, I used a One by Wacom . With the tablet connected, I could access the Pop-up Palette by pressing the brush icon and clicking a button on the tablet's pen. With the palette displayed, I chose the pencil brush to start the drawings. Then I started drawing over my first draft and correcting the perspective and lines with a tool called Assitant Tool , a set of rulers that helps with straight lines, ellipses and perpective drawings. I took advantage from the layer feature to create some components and align them with other details that already had been drawn before. Finally, I repeated this process of overlaying the drawing on the draft with the pencil brush until I get the following result: References: For fullfilling this concept sketch with Krita, I needed some help with a few tools. Here it is the videos I watched to get some orientation towards them: Importing Images into Krita: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aqrGjwndiU Assistant Tool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu463N_9gwY Eraser Tool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHgJvNKjquk Pop-up Palette Customization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2QEFQ16iiM Inkscape \u00b6 I used the Inkscape software to develop a logo for my documentation site. Inkscape is a software that use vectors to build illustrations and drawings. Vectors graphics are lines or shapes build by sequencial commands or mathematical statements. Those graphics have the advantage of keeping the resolution and quality no matter its size, performing as a great tool to develop a logo for the project. Here are the steps used for the logo development: First of all, I needed to use a image as reference to develop the logo. To do that I imported to Microsoft Paint , a native illustration software from Windows, the concept sketch developed in Krita and cutted the sideview using the selection tool. ![Paint Screenshot 2](.center .image} Then I draged this imaged into the Inkscape workspace. I used a tool called Bezier to draw over the image. With the Bezier tool I created the shapes referring to each components. I assembled the shapes by dragging them and positioining them according to the reference image. The result looked like this: I created a frame around the vector drawing using the circle tool . With the circle geometry selected, I changed the stroke width by 5mm in the Fill and Stroke feature, inside the Stroke Style tab I centralized the circle with the drawing using the Center on Vertical Axis and Center on Horizontal Axis in the Align and Disttribute feature. I sent the circle back to the drawing and adjusted the size of the circle. Finally the logo will look like the image below: 3D Softwares \u00b6 Autodesk Fusion 360 \u00b6 Autodesk Fusion 360 is the software I chose for modeling my plastic injector. Here it is the steps I followed to build my digital model: I brought the same image used in the Inkscape to Fusion by insertting a canvas into the workspace. Then the software asked me which plan I wanted to place the canvas. I placed it in the ZY plane. With the canvas placed, it is possible to model over it. Analogous process to the one used in the process with Krita. I started creating a sketch over the canvas. With the following tools (line, rectangle and circle) I created the profile, in ZX plane, according to the canvas dimensions. I also used the sketch dimension tool to define the measures of the geometry. I extruded the profile with the Extrude Tool with the right height dimension, following again the reference from canvas. Then I repeated the same process of sketching and extruding, now in the ZY plane. I repeat this two operation one more time. But the extrude operation was used as a cut tool, to create the side profife of the component. I used the Chamfer Tool to create a chamfer the corners of the two parts remaining after the cut. Then I used the Loft Tool to close the geometry by selecting the two profiles shaded in blue. I repeated this process to build the other components of my project. For the thread responsible to push the plastic into the chamber and the thread from the vise I needed to build a cylinder. Once again I drawed a circle as profile for extrusion. Then I created a thread with the Thread Tool by selecting the side surface from the body. The result of the 3D modeling using those tools (sketch, extrude, loft and thread) looked like this: Tinkercad \u00b6 In the Tinkercad, another 3D software from Autodesk which work in the browser and does not need to be installed, I modeled the PID controller enclosure. Here it is the steps: In the Fusion 360 I selected the upper part of the plastic injector with the right button of the mouse and exported it as a STL file. With Tinkercad opened, I imported the STL file by clicking over the button located at the upper right side of the interface. After that, the software asked me to select the file you want to import by dragging it over the specified area. Another window will appear where I set up the unities of measuments and the size of the model. In this case, I selected milimeters and kept the model size. With the model imported I adjusted the positioning the model to be able to work with it as I wanted. At the right side of the interface, I chose a cube and positioned it next to upper part of the plastic injector. Clicking over the cube, I dragged the blacked quare dots resizing the object according to the following dimensions. I created another cube and I repeated the process resizing the object according to the images below. I aligned both objects and moved the smaller prism 50mm along to z axis. I stretched the small prism to its body cross over the PID body. I displayed it as a Hole and I used the Group feature to cut the model. Then I created a wedge and repeated the last 3 steps to create a new cut on the enclosure body, to create a diagonal finishing at its upper side. Now I need to create a shel from this body. I duplicated the object by pressing Ctrl+D , displayed it as a hole, and resized it to be 3mm less in each side of the body. I created another cube as a hole, resized it and positioned it as a prolongation of the hole. Grouping those two hole objects with the enclosure, I got the following result. Following the same features and process presented before, I created a representation of the PID panel. Finally I exported a new STL mesh from the Tinkercad and imported again into Fusion, positioning the enclosure with the plastic injector body.","title":"3.Computer-Aided Design"},{"location":"Computer-Aided%20Design/#3-computer-aided-design","text":"","title":"3.

Computer-Controlled Cutting \u00b6 Group Assignment \u00b6 Characterize your lasercutter's focus, power, speed, rate, kerf, joint clearance and types Material \u00b6 3mm MDF (Medium-density fibreboard) sheet. Sofware \u00b6 The laser cutter machine is Duplotech 1080 from Duplo J and its software is called RDWorks (RDCAM) . It can support .dxf and .bitmap files. Focus \u00b6 The laser cutter has a manual focus. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the distance between the material surface and the laser nozzle must be 6 mm. Therefore, we placed a 6 mm thickness piece of acrylic between the MDF sheet and the laser nozzle (the two screws highlighted in the picture below can be handled to allow the cannon to be free or fixed). Setting Test (power, speed, rate) \u00b6 To get a better sense of what the best parameters are for cutting and engraving we developed two tests, one of power(%) vs speed(mm/s) for testing cutting parameters and another one with interval(mm) vs power(%) using a fixed speed of 350mm/s to test engraving parameters. We set different parameters up divided by colors. You can download the setting test file here .

Through her files I could import her design in Fusion 360 and work over it. Kellie Dunn's used cardboard sheet to produce the pieces that constitute her kit. In my case, since I used 3mm MDF sheets, I needed to adjust the cuts for the press-fit. To create the cuts according to what I planned, I modeled and positioned all the pieces as I had envisioned. After modeling the pieces, I exported its sketch as a .dxf file and brought it in RDWorks . I positioned all the 32 pieces according to the size of MDF sheets I had avaiable. Since I was using scraps of sheets, I organized it in small groups like the image below: From RDWorks I sent the drawings as a cut file to the laser cutter and started the process of fabrication of the pieces. The images below show the results and the kit assembling process. Vinyl Cutter Assignment \u00b6 For the vinyl cutter exercise, I used the logo developed through Inkscape in the Computer-Aided Design assingment to create a sticker . But before sending the logo to the machine, I needed to adjust the size of the image according to the size I wanted for the sticker. I did it changing the values, in millimeters, described in the boxes in the upper side of the Inkscape interface. The H means \"height\" and the W means \"width\". After rezising the logo as I wanted, I saved it in a .pdf file. I connected my lap top with the vinyl cutter machine using a USB cable and placed a scrap of vinyl in the machine. Then I ran a routine in the machine called \"piece\" which makes the machine identify the material and display the dimension avaiable for cuts, what in this case was 114 x 157mm. In the lap top, I open the .pdf file in the Adobe Acrobat Reader and pres the print button. With the print configuration window opened, I selected Roland GX-24 as my printer. I selected the Properties button and git the cutting area from machine. Finally I closed the properties window and pressed the print button. The machine started to cut the sticker.

In the lap top, I open the .pdf file in the Adobe Acrobat Reader and pres the print button. With the print configuration window opened, I selected Roland GX-24 as my printer. I selected the Properties button and git the cutting area from machine. Finally I closed the properties window and pressed the print button. The machine started to cut the sticker.

An Obstacle On The Way \u00b6 3D printers can be a great tool to create models and prototypes in polymers. In many cases we are able to perform structural tests on printed models with results very close to a molded part, evidencing the great efficiency of this technology when considering the development of products made in plastic injection. Unfortunately, characteristics of this production process like mold extraction vector tests for the mold, flexibility and textures of the molded part, as well as the finishing of the product cannot be validated with a 3D printed prototype. This is a scenery that happened with a few projects I was involved in 2020. The main obstacle I came across with those projects was when I had a 3D printed prototype that was tested and validated and the next step of the development was to start the tests with the injection mold. But at this point, it appeared a series of questions that should have been answered like: What resin I should use in the injection mold? Polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) or polystyrene? Will the molded part have the same performance, structurally, as the 3D printed part? Will it be more rigid or more flexible? Will the texture I designed for the product has the same feel as the printed part? Will it be possible to reproduce my design in an injection mold, or will I have to adjust it? It was not possible to answer those questions in the Fab Lab, because we didnt have a proper equipment to prototype the process of injection mold. And it looked risky to order the production of a mold and to rent the use of a plastic injection molding machine when the big investment to do it is considered. The big question came up then: Can I develop, in the Fab Lab, an equipment able to fulfill this need? The Idea \u00b6 The answer for the previous question was, somehow, simple: the development of a mini injection mold machine. Despite the simple answer, developing it would not be easy. But having a desktop injection mold machine that could work with reused plastics from packaging to create more faithful models of plastic products seemed very promising to me. Therefore, I chose this idea as an object of study and development for the Fab Academy course. Who will use it? \u00b6 My plan is using this new machine to equip the Insper Fab Lab where I work. It is expected that the Fab Lab users who want to develop projects with plastic parts will be able to use the equipment to aid in their development process. Using past difficulties during the development of projects in 2020 as a case, the main goal is having this equipment avaiable for other users who would be developing projects with plastic parts. Final Project Concept \u00b6 To build the design for the injection mold machine, I chose to develop a structure similar to the bench drill stands. The main reference for this project is a DIY injection mold machine made by Buster Beagle 3D . I chose this structure because the alternative, a horizontal structure that consist in a thread responsible to inject the plastic, would demand a larger space to be occupied on the desk. By making this choice, I would restrict the size of the mold that could be used for injection. But it would not be a problem since it would still be possible to validate all the questions raised above. If the project demands a bigger mold, it would still be possible to prototype a scaled model of the developing part. Ideation Sketches \u00b6 Concept Sketch \u00b6 Problem Statement \u00b6 It is to develop a desktop plastic injection machine in order to meet the need to create plastic prototypes that are more faithful to those that will be produced industrially, making it possible to resolve doubts regarding the development of the mold and the plastic resin to be used in the production.

Project Management \u00b6 The Assignment \u00b6 Build a personal website describing you and your final project. Work through a git tutorial. Building the Website \u00b6 To build my personal website for the final project documentation, I needed to learn a few tools and plataforms to make it possible. As my work team are also taking the Fab Academy course, we agreed to create a pattern for the projects documentation. And to do it, we researched and indentified the following needed tools to build the website: Git : An open-source version control system used for creating a history of changes in the source code of software's development project. GitHub : A remote repository hosting service workins as an online Git. Markdown : A \"text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers\" according to Jon Gruber, its creator. It is a tool that allows writing using plain text, converting it to a valid XHTML structure.. Mkdocs : A static website generator for building project documention. Its source files are written in Markdown and set in a single YAML configuration file. Both Git and Github I already used a few times before. I learned a little about version control with Git and Github in a course on Alura , a online courses platform. But I never used Markdown and Mkdocs before, despite having already heard about them. During the website building process I learned how to use them, discovering and testing about the functions, tools, etc. My main reference to create the website was from my co-worker Eliana Rodrigues Martins, who started developing her documentation before me and already discovered how to navigate with those tools. Following are the steps I took to create the documentation website for my Fab Academy projects. Installing Python, Git, Mkdocs and Materials for Mkdocs \u00b6 Operating System: Windows 10 Download the most recent version of Python . Install it. The instalation process is straight foward. Repeat the same process with Git With Git installed, it will be able to access a terminal called Git Bash . Open it and type the following command: $ python --version If the installation process worked you should see the Python version installed, as shown bellow: $ python --version Python 3.8.2 Check if the Pip command is avaiable by typing the following: $ pip --version If pip is installed, the terminal will return the following information: $ pip --version pip 21.1.2 from c:\\program files\\python39\\lib\\site-packages\\pip (python 3.9) Usually Pip is installed with Python. Now is time to install Mkdocs, using the following command in the terminal: $ pip install mkdocs After the installation is done, it is going to be possible to start the website building. In the Mkdocs website you can follow the first steps to prepare the documentation in your own static website. You cand find the guide in the Getting Started section. This guide will teach you how to create a new project as wel as adding pages, theming the documentation and using icons through the YAML configuration file. In my project, I used a theme called Materials for Mkdocs . Since it is a theme that does not come with Mkdocs, I needed to install it using the following line: $ pip install mkdocs-material With the theme installed, I just needed to set the name material on the folowwing line in the mkdocs.yml file to use it. Write the following command line in the terminal to preview the new site with the Material theme: $ mkdocs serve Setting up the theme colors \u00b6 Material for Mkdocs allows the user to customize the colors of the theme. I followed the instuction found in the Changing the color section to customize my documentation site. Unfortunatly I could not identify myself with the color palette and with the combination options offered by the theme. Then I could discovered how to create my own color scheme. Here it is the steps to create your own color scheme: At the Changing the color section, scroll down until you find the orientations about Custom colors and custom color schemes. Basically, you will have to add new colors in a extra.css located at *you-project-folder/docs/stylesheets. You will need to define the values of certain css variables to add new colors. To check out which variables are avaiable you can use the color definition section. Since the colors definition is set by hexadecimal code, I used the Adobe Color to help me to set my color scheme. Adobe Color has a tool to extract the color palette from images. As a great fan from art noveau and Toulouse Lautrec, I defined my color scheme from the Jane Avril poster. The tool returns the respective hexadecimal code values of the colors. With those informations, I configured my light and dark theme in the extra.css file like the image below: With this file configured, my documentation site will looks like the one you are navigating now. Deploying to Github and Automating the Process \u00b6 Now it is time to deploy our website to GitHub, and finally have it online on the internet. To do it I followed the Allithy Tutorial , more specifically in the \"Deploy para o Github\" section. With the tutorial, we are going to get a URL address for our documentation site. In my case the address was https://leonrosa.github.io/FabAcademy/ . Once the files are on the GitHub repository, everytime that we need to make an update we will need to repeat the deployment process. To make this step easier, I chose to automated following the Parker Erickson tutorial . Install all dependencies before update the documentation. Create the file 'requirement.txt' on the roof of the documentation main folder. Inside the file, write the following lines: mkdocs>=1.1 mkdocs-material>=7.1 Pygments>=2.4 markdown>=3.2 pymdown-extensions>=7.0 mkdocs-material-extensions>=1.0 Finally, install them adding the following command in the YAML file found inside the 'my-project\\ .github\\workflows' folder: - name: Install dependencies run: | pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin Code Editor and Terminal \u00b6 To build and develop my documentation website, I needed to use a code editor software. The software was needed to edit the YAML files and create the texts in Markdown . In my documentation I chose the Visual Studio Code to use, a Microsoft code editor. I also needed to use the terminal to install and operate the Mkdocs server. Since I already used Linux before and I am used to its commands, I chose the Git Bash as my main terminal. Besides my choice, the steps above can also be fulfilled with other code editors like Notepad++ , Atom and Sublime and/or with other terminals like the Command Prompt from Windows operating system. References \u00b6 For more informations related with inserting images, code blocks, buttons, lists, etc. you can read the Material for Mkdocs references . But the informations in the link doesnt cover the information to add videos in the documentation. To do it I can follow two methods, one for Youtube videos and the other for videos files located in my computer. The methods are: Videos Youtube videos Go to the Video page on YouTube and click on the Share Button. Choose Embed. Copy and Paste the HTML snippet in your markdown. Example: <center> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4gGWufoIYI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center> Result: Local videos To add a local video in the documentation site, we can do it through a issue in GitHub. But the video will be restricted to until 10MB, what does it mean that the video need to be short to be uploaded Then copy the address video and paste into your file like the code below.
