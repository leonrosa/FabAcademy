[Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is a software for illustration creation, concept art, animation and it can also be used as photo editting tool. Krita works with [**raster images**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vector-vs-raster-graphics/) what is a image that uses bits to store information. With more bits, more resolution we get from the image but more disk space the image will take up. 

I chose Krita to create, to refine, and to render my concept skecth presented in my [Principles and Practices](https://leonrosa.github.io/FabAcademy/Principles%20and%20Practices/) page. Here it is the steps I used sketch my project:

1. My first step was creating a sketch by hand.

    &nbsp;

2. I took a picture of it and imported it into Krita.

    &nbsp; 

3. Krita has features very similar to Photoshop where I can control layers to work on the drawing. Then I included the picture in my second layer, to use it as reference for my next steps.

4. The next step was to start drawing over the picture to refine the sketch. Then I created one more layer over it.

5. To make drawings in Krita, I used a [One by Wacom](https://www.wacom.com/pt-br/products/one-by-wacom). With the tablet connected, I could access the [Pop-up Palette](https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/popup-palette.html) by pressing the brush icon and clicking a button on the tablet's pen. With the palette displayed, I chose the pencil brush to start the drawings.

6. Then I started drawing over my first draft and correcting the perspective and lines with a tool called [Assitant Tool](https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/tools/assistant.html), a set of rulers that helps with straight lines, ellipses and perpective drawings.

7. I took advantage from the layer feature to create some components and align them with other details that already had been drawn before.

8. Finally, I repeated this process of overlaying the drawing on the draft with the pencil brush until I get the following result:

**References:** For fullfilling this concept sketch with Krita, I needed some help with a few tools. Here it is the videos I watched to get some orientation towards them:
