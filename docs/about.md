# About

I am a industrial designer from São Paulo, graduated by Centro Universitário Senac. I have been involved with Fab Labs for the last 6 years, where I started as technician in the public Fab Lab of Parque Chácara do Jockey and then, in 2018, I migrated to Insper Fab Lab where I also work as technician.

It was in the Industrial Design program where I discovery my passion for building and assigning function to objects. The possibility to change the reality creating interactions between human and object and how this aspect is planned since the product concept called my attention. In college I was a student who spent more time in laboratories and workshops than the classroom. I was taught, since the beginning, that the best and quicker way of learning was making things and experimenting them.

This learning method has great synergy with a FabLab. As soon as I graduated I started to work in a public FabLab in Parque Chácara do Jockey where the main goal of the laboratory was to bring the digital fabrication technology to the comunity around the park. I was responsible to develop workshop classes in order to empower the comunity in the tools and machines of the FabLab, as well as the engagement of schools, NGOs and collectives for the potential that the space offered.
