# About Me

Currently working as technician in Insper Fab Lab, São Paulo. I have a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design by Centro Universitário Senac. Since my graduation I have been involved with digital fabrication and prototyping proccess. 

I worked in a public network of Fab Labs between 2015 and 2018, where I had the oportunity to develop projects and workshops with the comunity in the region. The main goal of the project were to turn the digital fabrication technology accessible to the poorest and neediest communities in São Paulo, providing free laboratories as learning and developing spaces.

Since 2018 I have been working in a Fab Lab at Insper, an educational institution of Business and Engineering. Here I work with the orientation of students and projects development for class subjects. In 2019, the team got involved with projects and researches related impact mitigation of coronavirus pandemic.

As a person who is always looking for new learnings, challenges and experiences, Im happy to join at this journey proposed by the Fab Academy.
